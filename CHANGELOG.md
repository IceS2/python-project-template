### Added

- Initial template structure

  Defines a python project structure, using the `src/package` pattern, adhering to the [PEP 621](https://peps.python.org/pep-0621/) usage of pyproject.toml. It also defines an initial `tests/` structure, initial `.gitignore`, `README.md` and `CHANGELOG.md` files. It is also possible to accept the default dev dependencies of `nox`, `pytest` and `ruff` that come with initial configurations as well.
